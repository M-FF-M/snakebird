# Snakebird

This is an implementation of Snakebird in JavaScript. The original
game was published by [Noumenon Games](http://noumenongames.com/)
and can be bought...
* ...on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/357300/Snakebird/)
* ...on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NoumenonGames.SnakeBird_Touch)
* ...on [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/snakebird/id1087075743?mt=8)

This __work is still in progress__. You can currently play all the original levels at
https://m-ff-m.github.io/snakebird/ or clone the repository and open index.html. In
addition, there are some levels that were used during development - however, they don't pose
an intellectual challenge. You may also create your own levels using the level editor.
Currently, levels can only be saved in localStorage. An option to save levels on disk will
be added in the near future. Visit [github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall)
for more levels (Snakefall levels can be loaded by clicking on 'Open' in the level editor
and then pasting the Snakefall level link).
