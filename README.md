# Snakebird

This is an implementation of Snakebird in JavaScript. The original
game was published by [Noumenon Games](http://noumenongames.com/)
and can be bought...
* ...on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/357300/Snakebird/)
* ...on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NoumenonGames.SnakeBird_Touch)
* ...on [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/snakebird/id1087075743?mt=8)

This __work is still in progress__. You can currently play all the original levels at
https://m-ff-m.github.io/snakebird/ or clone the repository and open index.html. In
addition, there are some levels used during development - however, they don't pose
an intellectual challenge. Due to the lack of a level editor (which is planned, but
the completion date could still be far away), these are the only levels available right
now. Visit [github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall)
for a level editor and more levels (a converter for their level format may follow in
the future as well).
